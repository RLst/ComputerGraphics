# Computer Graphics OpenGL Tech Demo

A computer graphics project that I wrote from the ground up in C++ using OpenGL. I wrote a shader in GLSL that is able to load in a textured obj model as well as be able to handle multiple lights.

Each light can be configured to be either a directional light like a sun, a omni light like a globe or a spot light.

The settings of each light are fully adjustable, including color, position, direction, brightness, attentuations and cut off angles.

The GUI and interface allows the user to easily position and rotate the lights with gizmos that transform and update to represent each light's setting.
